# Appdaemon-Snips-Skills
Skills for the Snips platform, based on Appdaemon. These files will enable your Snips setup to carry out some functions. My code is not entirely complete in parsing the raw data from Snips, as I have that done in a different way hacky way. But one could use the project by Tod Schmidt (https://github.com/tschmidty69/jarvis-appdaemon), or use my simple `parse_slots` function, and simply pass the returned slots data to each skill as needed and play back the text; please ensure before passing to the `parse_slots` function, `json.loads()`, has been used on the payload read from the mqtt server. Here I am assuming that has been done, and intent known before slots ae parsed with this. Will try to make it as neat as I can. Not a professional programmer, so if better ways of writing the code noticed, please do let me know.
