# Appdaemon-Snips-Skills
Skills for the Snips platform, based on Appdaemon. These files will enable your Snips setup to carry out some functions. My code is not entirely complete in parsing the raw data from Snips, as I have that done in a different way. But one could use the project by Tod Schmidt (https://github.com/tschmidty69/jarvis-appdaemon), and simple pass the slots data to each functions and play back the text. Will try to make it as neat as I can. not a professional programmer, so if better ways of writing the code noticed, please do let me know.
